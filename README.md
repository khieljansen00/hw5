I am available to extend the instructions of HW5 to a successful standpoint. I implement the tiles and draggable and droppable features for which is by the jquery UI. I also implement a feature to submit the words which is a button at the bottom. When a user clicks the submit button, the letter tiles that are on the board are counted for and the score for this word is recorded and printed on the screen. 
A few errors are caught, if there are no tiles on the board, the submit button does produce an error message. And if the letters are not directly next to each other, than the submit button does provide this error message too. The submit button wont allow the submission of letter tiles that do not sit correctly of which the letters have to be directly next to each other.
Both the score for this word and the total scores are recorded and printed on the screen.
The proper scores are calculated of which each letter does correspond to a proper score sheet.
